              <p class="card-text">"This pub is in downtown Wolfville & seemed to be quite popular. I’d never tried hard cider before & didn’t know what to expect. Staff (& patrons!) were very helpful in making suggestions & pouring tasting samples. Staff also knew particulars of taking hard cider back through US Customs. There were many different kinds & I bought 3 bottles."</p>

              <p class="card-text">"AMAZING CIDERS! Thank you to David who did an incredible job presenting us the different ciders. We had an amazing tasting experience and a hard time chosing our favorite :P

1- The most easy-going cider was their signature Heirloom cider.
2- My favorite was the Hopped Pear (which was a surprise since I'm not fan of hopped nor pear!).
3- My partner's favorite was the Earl Blue (earl grey tea and blueberry).
4- Our fourth pick was their "Something different" of the moment, which had a pleasant wild-flower taste.

Go there! For the quality of the service and the amazing variety of ciders!"</p>

              <p class="card-text">"Cute place, great ciders. I got a flight of ciders and they were all good -- so good that I brought a 3-pack home. I especially liked the hopped pear and the sour cherry. I'm not much of a cider fan in general, but these were spectacular"</p>
