              <h5 class="card-title">John Cypress</h5>
              <p class="card-text">"nitially we were surprised to see how small the place was and not a lot of ambiance, but wow the food, Probably seating for only about 20 people and a somewhat open kitchen. The menu changes to what is fresh and it was a bit late in the season so it was a bit limited. We started with the beef tartare which was different from what we expected as it had an Asian twist but it was delicious. Also had the oysters with the chefs own fresh hot sauce, also tasty. My wife had the crispy skin salmon which was supposed to come with leaks and peppers but she doesn’t like peppers so the chef graciously whipped up a fantastic cauliflower with hazelnut brown butter which was fantastic. I had the pork Milanese with prosciutto basil green beans which was exceptional. If you have room for it don’t miss the chocolate eclair for desert, it is heavenly."</p>

              <p class="card-text">"Pros: Excellent food. Very good tuna crudo with herbs and lemon. Good charred cabbage, needed a touch more vinegar. Halibut and scallops had a yummy corn sauce. Steak with salsa verde was good. Desserts did not look inspired so skipped. Cons: Portions are small, so on the pricey side. Too loud to talk when busy. $5 for can of Perrier."</p>
